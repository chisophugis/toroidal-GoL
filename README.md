Conway's Game of Life with toroidal topology.

Usually GoL is done on an infinite world. I'm interested in exploring how
the usual GoL changes when done with a fixed size grid with toroidal
topology (that's just a fancy way of saying that when you go off one side
you appear on the other, like in Asteroids).
